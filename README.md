The files contained within this project were created for a student electronic project formed within the "Project in Electronics" course at Uppsala University. The course is a part of the "Master's Programme in Electrical Engineering" and took place between the fall of 2023 and spring 2024.

Würth Electronik donated all the horticulture parts involved - LEDs and Power Modules (MagI³C Series). The rest of the parts were purchased by Uppsala University. More details about the course and program can be found below.

This project's core purpose is to engineer and deploy a ‘Smart Grow System’, that harmoniously integrates analog and digital electronics in order to facilitate the growth of simple plants and spices. SmartGrowSystems utilizes horticulture LEDs (“HLEDs”) in different colors and wavelengths along with a pneumatic pump watering system to mimic a natural environment. This allows for the plant to grow regardless of its surrounding conditions. This endeavor aims to leverage simulation software for electronic circuit analysis, facilitating seamless data acquisition from sensors, precise data management using a microcontroller, and the merging of analog and digital methodologies. As aspiring electrical engineers, our primary objective is to comprehend and apply the intricacies of circuit design, signal acquisition, manipulation, and control within the context of our Smart Grow System. This pursuit not only forms the cornerstone of our educational journey but also equips us with indispensable skills to innovate and contribute to the dynamic landscape of electrical engineering.

Big thanks to all involved in the project as well. The circuit board designs, both the LED circuit board and the LED driver, were designed in autodesk fusion and soldered by Haza Newman.
